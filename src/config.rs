"The Hakursa is the largest organism in the
Irr'Hakur oasis, a colossal, mass of segmented
muscle and primitive sensory ridges running the
length of its body. The Hakursa patrols the pond
continuously, gliding through the water in slow,
deliberate arcs. When it detects vibrations from
Dunetide swarms or the darting pulses of a Gharlox,
it accelerates in a sudden but sustained pursuit,
sweeping its flexible jaws sideways to engulf its
target whole.
Its presence is constant, every creature in the
oasis adjusts its behavior when the low-frequency
hum of its movement passes through the water.
Desert myths call it \"the living tide\", believing
the pond itself retreats when a Hakursa dies.";

"Sahlalga grows in buoyant mats across the pondâ€™s
surface. Its body is a sheet of interwoven
filaments with many simple light-harvesting plates
(analogous to chloroplasts) arranged in layered
membranes to catch harsh, angled desert light. The
filaments form small gas bladders that keep the
mat near the surface so it receives steady
illumination at midday. Ancient oasis maps show
Sahlalga rings as markers of deep water; elders
say the mats hum in heat. Ecologically it is a
slow but resilient energy accumulator and the
dominant surface producer.",

packed, crystalline cells, it scatters and refracts

Its thin mucilaginous layer traps silt and
stabilizes the substrate. Mirajun is the fast-
regenerating primary producer of the shallow

"Dunetide is a compact, colonial grazer that swims
in slow pulses across Mirajun and Sahlalga. Each
animal is a modular cluster of ciliated units with
a simple mouth-like feeding groove that scrapes and
ingests biofilm. It senses chemical cues with
distributed receptor cells and performs rapid jet-
like escapes by coordinated ciliary reversals.
Tribes call them \"glass-paddles\" for the way
sunlight fractures through their bodies when they
flee. Dunetide is the main mobile plant consumer
and shelters in deeper water columns when predators
are near.",

"Gharlox is a low-profile, soft-bodied hunter that
patrols reedbeds and submerged stone.
Morphologically simple, it has a tubular, suction
mouth and rows of mechanosensory papillae;
propulsion is by muscular contractions and flicking
flaps rather than fins. Gharlox lies in wait in
shadow, then creates a sudden suction to pull
nearby Dunetide from their grazing patches. Its
nervous system is a compact nerve net giving fast
local reflexes but limited long-range planning, so
it abandons kills when larger scents or vibrations
(Hakursa) approach. Hunters carved the Gharlox
silhouette as a symbol of patience.",
